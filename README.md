# 666AB
666 Aimbot is a simple color code aimbot in C#

## Requirements:
- [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/) 
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (I am using Visual Studio 2022 Community)
## How to configure/use?

- To configure what color the aimbot clicks on change hex color on line 42 (it beings with 0x)
- To configure where the aimbot searches use [AutoIt Window Info Tool](https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/intro/au3spy.htm) to find the postiton on the top left of the area you want to search and the bottom right of the area and change the first numbers that are in parenthesis on line 42 to the top left postion number and the second set of numbers to the bottom right postion numbers.

- Here is an image if you are confused about which numbers are which. ![Example](https://i.imgur.com/KgFGQws.jpg)
 
 **Once you have changed the colors and/or postions build it.**


## If you want to use it on the [Human Benchmark Aim Trainer](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/aim) you can download it from [Releases](https://github.com/syntheistic/666AB/releases/tag/releases)
